# Pleroma & Kenoma
A minimalist solitaire game of light and dark.

*A thing becomes empty when it rids itself of its fullness, and vice versa. Only in the space between all and none can peace be found.*

A 48 hour project for the Concordia Game Jam. Play it here: https://oneirical.itch.io/plerokeno

Overall, I had a very hard time making this. This was the first true Rust project I embarked on, and I had not used Bevy before beyond the absolute basics. The Entity-Component-System is a completely different way to look at the way a game works.

I often felt blocked and unproductive, and feel like I could have implemented more of my ideas (some lore text, some unique powers) had I used tooling I was more familiar with.

Looking at the other games of this jam, it is clear Bevy is not quite at the level of Unity or Godot yet. But I am glad I tried it. Even if I don't stand out from the lot, I appreciate the learning experience this has given me.
